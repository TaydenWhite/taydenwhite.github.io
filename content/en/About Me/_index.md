Hi! My name is Tayden White and this is my personal website. I built this site during an internship at Johnson & Johnson, where I learned a great deal, including subjects like data engineering, machine learning, and static websites. Currently, I am a rising sophomore at Purdue University, pursuing degrees in both Computer Science and Mathematical Economics. While coding has always been a passion of mine -- I have fond memories of building my first tic-tac-toe in python the summer before Freshman year -- , my interest in economics is relatively new.
