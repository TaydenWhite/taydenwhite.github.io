The speculum that held my eye open was almost the worst part of the surgery, second only to the laser that fried the first layer of skin cells on my eyes. The doctors followed a simple routine – 30 seconds with the laser, 2 minutes of rest, and an application of yellow drops that coated my eyes to numb the pain. The drops were almost as cold as the room, but as Bruno Mars’s “The Other Side” played in my left ear, I gathered some remaining willpower to persevere. The two-hour process was almost done, and I could hold on for another couple of minutes. With a pair of light-sensitive goggles strapped on my face, I walked out of Kremer Eye Center's chiseled tan building with the cross-linking procedure completed.

However, as the days passed, it was not the cost of the surgery, or the pain felt that lingered with me. It was what the secretary stated to my father and mother, that “some of our patients see that bill you have in front of you and can’t afford it. It’s unfortunate that they’re denied this life-changing treatment.” The gravity of the situation dawned on me, and I began to appreciate the subtle, yet influential engineering innovations that allowed for the preservation of my vision. According to Johns Hopkins University, 1 in 2000 people are diagnosed with keratoconus, often in their mid-30s. Thankfully, I learned about my condition and received the cross-linking procedure before I turned 17. While I have always had problems with my eyes due to my nearsightedness, color blindness, and keratoconus, I took the support systems for granted. After the surgery, my sight allowed me to have a new vision to make these procedures affordable and accessible.
