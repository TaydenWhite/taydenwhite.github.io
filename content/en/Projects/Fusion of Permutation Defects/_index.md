In the Summer of 2025, I was an Undergraduate Research Assistant for Professor Colleen Delaney for the Purdue Math Department. Our work centered around the fusion of permutation defects, multilayered two-dimensional quasiparticles that Dr. Delaney had previously written a paper on. The fusion of these particles has implications in the topological approach for creating qubits in quantum computing.

 Below is a video I submitted to Purdue's Undergraduate Research Exposition, detailing permutation defects and Dr. Delaneys work on describing their fusion:

Note: This video was made in the middle of my research, so the back-tracking assertion towards the end of the video were proven to be false by calculations I completed later on (see Fusion Rules in n = 4).
