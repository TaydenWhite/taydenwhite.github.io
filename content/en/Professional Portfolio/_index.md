As a chemical engineer, I want to showcase some of my most important experiences. This portfolio showcases some of the content that I learned in J&J, two lab reports that I wrote about Physics 2, and a paper from my Engineering 0412 class, where two of my peers and I presented in Pitt's annual first year engineering conference. I'm always eager to take on new challenges. Let's connect!
