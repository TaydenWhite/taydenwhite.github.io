<p class="lead mt-5">Hi, my name is Tayden White, I am a Junior at Purdue University pursuing dual-degrees in Computer Science and Economics. These subjects have been my forefront interests since I learned Python in 8th grade, while the stock market or some financial question would act as inspiration, coding was my medium for learning. In having opposite yet compatible proficiencies, I have gained an extremely well-rounded skillset, and taken a diverse range of opportunities. I initially built this website during an internship at Johnson & Johnson, where I learned a great deal about data engineering, machine learning, and building websites. In the projects tab you can find “Website Tutorials,” an initiative I led during my internship to educate my coworkers about the process of making your own personal site.
